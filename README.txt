Vowel Trackers
This game is based on Mario Party 3's "The Beat Goes On" minigame. It is a 2-Player text-based memorization game. 
The game starts with a set of 5 randomly selected vowels (A, E, I, O, U, Y) being shown to all players. 
Then when P1 types 'ready', the vowels are then hidden from the player, and it transitions to their turn.
(It's intended that after 'ready' is typed, the players wait out a short amount of time--say 8 seconds--in order to make memorizing the vowels challenging , but not unfair)
Each turn, the designated player tries to type the same vowels as in the string, and add an extra vowel of their choice.
If they get the initial string correct, it transitions to the next player, who repeats the string, including the previously added vowels, and adds another 1.
Repeat until either 1 of the players gets part of the string wrong (meaning the other one wins), or the string hits 25 Vowels at the end of Turn 10 (meaning a draw)
